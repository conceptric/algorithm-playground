# Algorithm Playground

This is a project to try out a few different types of algorithm. 
It's pretty basic stuff because I'm a beginner, no Computer Science degree see.

## Sort Algorithms

This is the first class of algorithm I'm going to play with

* Insertion sort.
* Merge sort.       

To try them with a random 100 element input array

    be rake benchmark
  
You can easily change the size of the dataset in the Rakefile, it's quite
quick with just 100 elements.
